Design a beautiful looking calculator that performs these basic functions:
1. Compute basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /, = and CE for clear)

2. Use functions as applicable. It is expected that you have a function for adding input, another one for 
computing the result, and another one for clearing the display

3. Use external javascript to execute this task

4. DO NOT copy YouTube codes for this assignment. DO NOT copy codes directly on AI, as this will be very obvious for me to spot

6. Share the link to your github repository OR the files you used for review

7. Kindly turn your work in by sending to my WhatsApp on or before Sunday, November 23, 2025 by 11:59pm. Late submission is strictly discouraged.

You are encouraged to reach out if you have any challenge during the development of this project.
